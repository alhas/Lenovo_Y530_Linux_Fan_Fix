I want to have a program that control the fan of y530.
If fan below 50C fan should freeze current state.
If fan over 50C fan should run automatically.
That way I will prevent fan kicking issue.

--------------------------
--Pseudo-code
while True:
	temp = Check temp state
	If Temp > 50C
		Set Auto Fan
	Else:
		Freeze Fan Status

Check if ec_probe is installed. If not Install it.

Make the program a service. Which should start at startup.
